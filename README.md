# EG Battle Bots
Small Scale Battle Bots Competition 
Created By: Teddy Polkosnik

## Purpose:
The aim of this community event is to give new TA’s Prototyping experience, an opportunity to bond/get to know other TA’s, and make a pretty cool project in the process. There is no previous knowledge/experience required to participate although it helps to have some. TA’s will create a small battle bot to battle in a tournament against other teams. I created this idea because I consider myself a maker and love to make cool stuff. In reality this was inspired by Proto’s use of mini “battle bots” to demonstrate physics concepts that are relevant to MRR/LAZ Robots.

## Overview:

### Design Phase:
Teams will have 1-2 weeks to design and manufacture a small Robot. After design and manufacturing has been completed it will then be checked by a member of proto to ensure that it follows all the rules and regulations of the competition. Groups are allowed to make design changes they deem necessary at any point in time during the competition as long as it falls within the rules and regulations. Design changes and prints will be given preference during the 1-2 week manufacturing window. After that window has passed groups can submit a request to print but cannot be guaranteed a print.

DISCLAIMER - Any member of proto is allowed to deny any Robot for any justified safety/design reason. Any member of proto is allowed to deny a print request for any justified reasons.

### Competition: 
Robot Teams will be randomly assigned to brackets. Each round will be 3 mins long with a 1 min break between each round for strategy discussion or quick repairs. Quick repairs include taping parts, plugging in a new battery/charging a battery, and or adjusting wheels and motors. There will be a maximum of 5 rounds. If after 5 rounds there is no winner then the game is declared a tie. Win = 3 points, Tie = 1 Points, Lose = 0 Points. 

DISCLAIMER -  If the repair takes longer than 1 min then it will be automatically considered a loss. 

Finals: The 4 teams with the most points will play 2 extra matches. The highest scoring team will have first choice on who they would like to play against. The remaining 2 teams will play against each other. Winners play winners for 1st and 2nd place and losers play losers for 3rd and 4th place.

Sample Structure:

| Team | Wins | Losses | Ties | Points |
| --- | ---   | ---    | ---  | ---    |
| Team 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 12|
| Team 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 10|
| Team 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 7 |
| Team 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 5 |
| Team 5 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 |
