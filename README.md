# EG Battle Bots
**Small Scale Battle Bots Competition Created By: Teddy Polkosnik**

</div>


## Purpose:
The aim of this community event is to give new TA’s Prototyping experience, an opportunity to bond/get to know other TA’s, and make a pretty cool project in the process. There is no previous knowledge/experience required to participate although it helps to have some. TA’s will create a small battle bot to compete in a tournament against other teams. I created this idea because I like to make cool stuff. In reality this was inspired by Proto’s use of mini “battle bots” to demonstrate physics concepts that are relevant to MRR/LAZ Robots.

> [!CAUTION]
> DISCLAIMER: This event was created with the intention of being solely volunteer based and is not required to participate if not interested. You will not be able to charge for the time you work on this project. This is intended as a community project to gain some prototyping experience not as a method to get some extra cash.

## Overview:

### Design Phase:
Teams will have 1-2 weeks to design and manufacture a small Robot. After design and manufacturing has been completed it will then be checked by a member of proto to ensure that it follows all the rules and regulations of the competition. Groups are allowed to make design changes they deem necessary at any point in time during the competition as long as it falls within the rules and regulations. Design changes and prints will be given preference during the 1-2 week manufacturing window. After that window has passed groups can submit a request to print but cannot be guaranteed a print.

> [!CAUTION]
> DISCLAIMER: Any member of proto is allowed to deny any Robot for any justified safety/design reason. Any member of proto is allowed to deny a print request for any justified reasons.


### Competition: 
Robot Teams will be randomly assigned to brackets. Each round will be 3 mins long with a 1 min break between each round for strategy discussion or quick repairs. Quick repairs include taping parts, plugging in a new battery/charging a battery, and or adjusting wheels and motors. There will be a maximum of 5 rounds. If after 5 rounds there is no winner then the game is declared a tie. Win = 3 points, Tie = 1 Points, Lose = 0 Points. 

> [!CAUTION]
> DISCLAIMER: If the repair takes longer than 1 min then it will be automatically considered a loss.


Finals: The 4 teams with the most points will play 2 extra matches. The highest scoring team will have first choice on who they would like to play against. The remaining 2 teams will play against each other. Winners play winners for 1st and 2nd place and losers play losers for 3rd and 4th place. In the "Sample Structure" shown below Team 1 chooses who they would like to battle against. The remaining 2 play each other. Winners play Winners for 1st and 2nd. Losers play losers for 3rd and 4th place.

| Team | Wins | Losses | Ties | Points |
| --- | ---   | ---    | ---  | ---    |
| Team 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 12|
| Team 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 10|
| Team 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 7 |
| Team 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 5 |
| Team 5 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To emphasize: In between games groups are allowed to make any repairs or modifications to a robot for strategic purposes as long as they fall inside of the rules and regulations of the competition. Prints will take preferences during the manufacturing window. After that groups cannot be dependent on them for parts in time.

### Timeline:
Teams will be given roughly 2 weeks to create thier bots. A team that is on track will most likely follow this timeline.

Ideal/Expected Timeline: 
- [Day 0 - 1] Friday Night: Groups are made 
- [Day 1 - 4] Monday - Tuesday: CAD/Design is completed 
- [Day 4 - 7] Tuesday - Friday: Trial/Error Manufacturing/Designing 
- [Day 7 - 14] Friday-Friday: Robot Tested and Manufactured

## Rules: 

### Robot Must Have: 
- Robots must be either autonomous OR controlled wirelessly (RF/WIFI/BLUETOOTH). 
- Robots must include 1 ability AND/OR 1 “weapon” (can have both but must have one).
- Robots must include a “KILL SWITCH” to stop the robot entirely.
- Robots must include protective casing around any sensors to prevent damage to components.
