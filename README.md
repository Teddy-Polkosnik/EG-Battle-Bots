## Purpose:
The aim of this community event is to give new TA’s Prototyping experience, an opportunity to bond/get to know other TA’s, and make a pretty cool project in the process. There is no previous knowledge/experience required to participate although it helps to have some. Teams of 3-5 TA's will create a small battle bot to compete in a tournament against other teams. I created this idea because I like to make cool stuff. In reality this was inspired by Proto’s use of mini “battle bots” to demonstrate physics concepts that are relevant to MRR/LAZ Robots.

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> DISCLAIMER: This event was created with the intention of being solely volunteer based and is not required to participate if not interested. You will not be able to charge for the time you work on this project. This is intended as a community project to gain some prototyping experience not as a method to get some extra cash.

## Overview:

### Design Phase:
Teams will have 2 weeks to design and manufacture a small battle Robot. After design and manufacturing has been completed it will then be checked by a member of proto to ensure that it follows all the rules and regulations of the competition. Groups are allowed to make design changes they deem necessary at any point in time during the competition as long as it falls within the rules and regulations. Design changes and prints will be given preference during the first week aka the manufacturing window. After that window has passed Teams can submit a request to print but cannot be guaranteed a print on time.

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> DISCLAIMER: Any member of proto is allowed to deny any Robot for any justified safety/design reason. Any member of proto is allowed to deny a print request for any justified reasons.

<br> 



### Competition: 
Robot Teams will be randomly assigned to play each other for points then go on to finals. Each round will be 3 mins long with a 1 min break between each round for strategy discussion or quick repairs. Quick repairs include taping parts, plugging in a new battery/charging a battery, and or adjusting wheels and motors. There will be a maximum of 5 rounds. If after 5 rounds there is no winner then the game is declared a tie.

<div align="center">
  
  **Point System** <br>
  Win = 3 points <br>
  Tie = 1 Points <br>
  Lose = 0 Points <br>

</div>


<br>

> [!WARNING]
> If the repair takes longer than 1 min then it will be automatically considered a loss.


Finals: The 4 teams with the most points will play 2 extra matches. The highest scoring team will have first choice on who they would like to play against. The remaining 2 teams will play against each other. Winners play winners for 1st and 2nd place and losers play losers for 3rd and 4th place. In the "Sample Structure" shown below Team 1 chooses who they would like to battle against. The remaining 2 play each other. Winners play Winners for 1st and 2nd. Losers play losers for 3rd and 4th place.

| Team 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 7 |
| Team 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 5 |
| Team 5 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 |

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To emphasize: In between games groups are allowed to make any repairs or modifications to a robot for strategic purposes as long as they fall inside of the rules and regulations of the competition. Prints will take preferences during the manufacturing window. After that groups cannot be dependent on them for parts in time.


<br> 

### Timeline:
Teams will be given roughly 2 weeks to create thier bots. A team that is on track will most likely follow this timeline.

<br>

### Combat: 
- 3 min rounds
- 1 min break 
- Teams are allowed to "pin" thier opponents for no more than 10 seconds. If pinned for longer will receive a “Stand Still” penalty.
- Teams are allowed to "TAP OUT" if feel Robot has sustained too much damage and can make repairs difficult. Tapping out will automatically be consided as a loss.


### Penalties:
- “Stand Still” - you will stand still / not move your robot for a total of 10 seconds. If you move before the 10 seconds are up then another 10 seconds will be added on to the penalty.

> [!CAUTION]
> DISCLAIMER: Proto is allowed to add to this list whenever necessary in order to maintain a fair and competitve environment.

### Size:
- [4in x 4in x 4in] Minimum
- [6in x 6in x 6in] Maximum

### Electrical:
There is a 3.3V Minimum and a 18V Maximum. You can use no more than 2 total, 9 Volt batteries total on the Robot. You may configure the batteries in a parallel or series configuration but note that you will not have the ability to change batteries during the break between rounds as both would be in use by your Robot. You can use no more than 900mAh total current. 

> [!NOTE]
> The standard 9V Battery ranges from 600mAh to 900mAh.

The battery to power your microcontroller is not included in the total count for the number of batteries. To clarify, 1 battery for the microcontroller + 1-2 batteries to power the motor(s).






## Safety:
At least 1 member of the Team must attend the safety meeting that will occur before all of the matches begin. It will cover safety precautions plus any and all last minute competition information.

[Safety Presentation](pending)







<br> 

## Bannable Offenses: 

The following are a list of offenses that will cause you to be kicked out of the competition.
- Any use of prohibited materials 
- Any violation of the rules
- Use of metal of any kind at all
- Purchasing extra materials of any kind
- Ignoring any safety precautions
- Cheating of any kind 

<br>




## How To Win?

**Win Conditions:**

The opposing Robot is unable to continue, this means but is not limited to: 
- Battery dies 
  - Justification: Your fault you didn’t charge it, you can replace/charge the battery in between rounds if you don’t go over the battery limit. (See Electrical Section)
- Robot Weapon Breaks
  - Justification: Broken means that it no longer has a method of attacking and therefore cannot win anymore.
- Robot is flipped over and cannot get up (10 seconds to get up similar to boxing)
  - Justification: The Robot cannot move around the arena 
- Robot can no longer traverse the arena (broken wheels/motor/movement…etc)
  - Justification: The Robot cannot move around the arena

In the event that both Robots cannot continue to move before the round ends then go to beyblade rules (last one moving wins) or you cannot determine which Robot stopped moving first then both teams will be allowed 3 mins to make adjustments to continue. After the 3 min
period the round will start and it will go back to beyblade rules.

> [!WARNING]
> If you aren’t sure if you will be in violation of any of the rules, contact proto ASAP.
